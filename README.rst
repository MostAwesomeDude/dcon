DCoN, the Doubly-linked Comic ORM for Newrem, is a simple, straightforward
webcomic management system. It differentiates itself from other comic
management systems by its architecture of Python, Flask, and SQLAlchemy, as
well as its ability to manage comics anachronistically.

DCoN relies on Ben Kero's osuchan library for its commenting system.
